# otree

Created a custom otree UI to power an experiment run in my experimental economics class. Whole thing was hosted on heroku. 

(Note: this was not normal for the class. I just made my own thing since the software everyone else used was horrible.)

This was technically a group project I frankly I did almost all the work (and all of this part of it for sure). 

Much more info about the experiment itself can be found on [this presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oAIrXfzF234GycNY1PsgXXbmuSC5Ey7Hsli-W_Yckcg/edit?usp=sharing)
