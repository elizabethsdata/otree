    There will be three stages of the experiment. Each stage will have 5 rounds. In each round, you will begin with an endowment of $10. You can choose to save or contribute this endowment in whole dollar amounts. $1 saved will be worth $1 throughout the experiment, whereas the structure of payout for contributions will be different in different stages. That structure will be specified at the beginning of each stage.
