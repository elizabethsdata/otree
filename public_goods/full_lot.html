    There will be three stages of the experiment. Each stage will have 5 rounds. In each round, you will begin with an endowment of $10. You can choose to save or contribute this endowment in whole dollar amounts. $1 saved will be worth $1 throughout the experiment, whereas the structure of payout for contributions will be different in different stages. That structure will be specified at the beginning of each stage.

<b>Stage 3: Full Lottery

</b>
</p>

<p>
    In this stage, all contributions are put towards the lottery, which works exactly the same as in stage 2.

</p>


<p>
    As with the previous example, if a group of 20 people each contributed the full $10, there would be a total contribution of $200. In this stage, the full $200 would go to whoever wins the draw, but the way odds are calculated does not change at all. They can be calculated as the individual contribution divided by the total contribution.
