<b>Stage 3: Full Lottery

</b>
</p>

<p>
    In this stage, all contributions are put towards the lottery, which works exactly the same as in stage 2.

</p>


<p>
    As with the previous example, if a group of 20 people each contributed the full $10, there would be a total contribution of $200. In this stage, the full $200 would go to whoever wins the draw, but the way odds are calculated does not change at all. They can be calculated as the individual contribution divided by the total contribution.
