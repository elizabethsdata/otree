<b>Stage 2: 50/50 Lottery
</b>
</p>

<p>
    In this stage, contributions are split into two pots. Pot 1 is a public good, where payouts are once more $.5 to everyone in the group. Pot 2 is a lottery, where winning chances are exactly proportional to contribution level and the winner takes everything. 

</p>


<p>
    For example, in a group of 20 people where everybody contributed the full $10, total contributions are $200. Half of this ($100) would act as a public good, which would result in a payout of $50 to each participant. The other $100 would be given to the winner of a draw. An individualâ€™s chance of winning the draw would depend on the amount of their individual contribution as well as the total contribution. In this case, each participant has a 5% chance of being chosen ($10 of their contribution / $200 of total contributions).
