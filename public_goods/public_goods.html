    There will be three stages of the experiment. Each stage will have 5 rounds. In each round, you will begin with an endowment of $10. You can choose to save or contribute this endowment in whole dollar amounts. $1 saved will be worth $1 throughout the experiment, whereas the structure of payout for contributions will be different in different stages. That structure will be specified at the beginning of each stage.

<b>Stage 1: Public Goods</b>
</p>

<p>
This stage is a classic public goods framework. $1 contributed will pay out $.5 to everyone in the group.
</p>

<p>
For example, in a group of 20 people where every participant contributed $5, total contributions are $100. This would result in a payout of $50 to each participant. Individual participantsâ€™ earnings would be the sum of the public goods payout plus their own savings. In this case, participants would have earnings of $55 ($5 from personal savings and $50 from the public goods pot).
