<b>Stage 1: Public Goods</b>
</p>

<p>
This stage is a classic public goods framework. $1 contributed will pay out $.5 to everyone in the group.
</p>

<p>
For example, in a group of 20 people where every participant contributed $5, total contributions are $100. This would result in a payout of $50 to each participant. Individual participantsâ€™ earnings would be the sum of the public goods payout plus their own savings. In this case, participants would have earnings of $55 ($5 from personal savings and $50 from the public goods pot).
